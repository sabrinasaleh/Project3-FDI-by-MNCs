# **Prediction of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in USA**

## ML Project Goal
* Develop an app based on machine learning model for predicting the FDI in USA by multinational corporations (MNCs)
* Utilize relevant features/factors of the investing countries in designing the model prediction 

## Variables, Measures, & Dataset 
* Time-Series Data Analysis for 30 Years
    - Year 1990 - Year 2019
    - Potential data size of 1000 to 1100  
    
* Dependent Variable: FDI in USA
    - Y: Total Stock of FDI by the investing countries in the USA
    - Data Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis; https://www.bea.gov    
    
* Independent Variables:
    - X1: GDP/Capita of the investing countries
    - X2: Stock Exchange indicator of the investing countries
    - X3: Doing Business indicator of the investing countries 
    - X4: Pro-Market indicator of the investing countries 
    - X5: Rule of Law indicator of the investing countries
    - X6: FDI by USA in the investing countries 
    - X7: Invidiual country indicator
    - X8: World regional indicator    
    - Data Source: World Bank; https://data.worldbank.org    
    
* Proposed Routes:
    1. Home: Description of the app
    2. Model: Analysis of the dataset, model development, and model selection 
    3. Input: Intaking relevant features/factors of the investing countries for predicting their FDI in USA
    4. Visualization: Plotly visulation with important charts and figures
